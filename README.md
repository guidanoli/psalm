# Markov Text Chaining in Psalm

This is an experiment and a way for me to learn more about this tool in a fun way. Also, this might become a bot if successes.

#### To Do:

+ A script that reads the unformatted psalm file and get a cohesive dictionary
+ A script that generates random texts given the dictionary and the text size
+ A bot that posts hourly a new randomly generated psalm
+ A good manager to control local and cloud functions
+ A page for the bot to act on
