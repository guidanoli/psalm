# Markov Text Chaining in Psalms

This is an experiment and a way for me to learn more about Markov Text Chaining in a fun way.

#### To Do:

+ ~~A script that reads the unformatted psalm file and get a cohesive dictionary~~
+ ~~A script that generates random texts given the dictionary and the text size~~
+ A bot that posts hourly a new randomly generated psalm
+ ~~A good manager to control local and cloud functions~~
+ A page for the bot to act on
+ Convert the dictionary to a file for easy access and fast computation
