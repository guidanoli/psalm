# Markov Text Chaining

This is an experiment and a way for me to learn more about Markov Text Chaining in a fun way.

#### How do use it:

1. Get a text file where the bot will act on and paste it on the repo folder
2. On the Manager...
   1. Reset settings with 'sd' and/or set them however you like with 'se'
   2. Make a dictionary file with 'md'
   3. Use any of the debug commands to get your random phrases

#### Manager commands:

- fc - posts as many posts as you'd like on Facebook
- fd - post once on Facebook
- g - generate Facebook SDK layer
- md - make dictionary out of text file
- pc - fc locally
- pd - fd locally
- r - remove all posts on the registered Facebook page
- s* - settings manager commands
- t* - tokens manager commands
- z - zip all files

Settings and Tokens managers are better documented on my Fibonacci Bot repo

#### To Do:

+ ~~A script that reads the unformatted psalm file and get a cohesive dictionary~~
+ ~~A script that generates random texts given the dictionary and the text size~~
+ A bot that posts hourly a new randomly generated psalm: **needs access token tool**
+ ~~A good manager to control local and cloud functions~~
+ ~~A page for the bot to act on~~
+ ~~Convert the dictionary to a file for easy access and fast computation~~
